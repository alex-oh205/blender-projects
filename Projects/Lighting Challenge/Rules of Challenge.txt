Open each of the three .blend files using Blender 2.8 (or later).
Add any number of lamps to create a final pleasing image. You may like to change world lighting, add background images, or objects to create interesting shadows.
You may also change the camera angle if you see fit.

Upload your final render set on http://www.reddit.com/r/blenderguru, including the words "Lighting Challenge" in the submission title.
